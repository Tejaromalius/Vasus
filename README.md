## Vasus VS Code Extension

### Introduction

Looking for a colorful coding environment while synched with your keyboard color? That's exactly what Vasus offers. It's tailored for ASUS devices running the Linux operating system, so you can immerse yourself fully in your coding experience.


### Prerequisites

Before diving into the synchronization magic, ensure that you have the `asusctl` command-line tool installed on your system. If not, you can build and install from their **[main repository](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl)**.

For an elevated experience, consider complementing Vasus with the Peacock extension. Peacock allows you to colorize your VS Code workspace, adding another layer of personalization to your development environment. Vasus seamlessly syncs your keyboard color with the active Peacock color, enhancing your coding ambiance.

### Usage

Once Vasus, `asusctl`, and Peacock are set up, _Vasus automatically syncs colors_, but if you wanted to do manually (which won't be necessary), you can do so by opening the command center `ctrl+shift+p` and write `Sync Keyboard Color to Status Bar Color`


### Troubleshooting

Should you encounter any hiccups along the way, double-check your VS Code color settings, ensuring they align with your preferences, especially the `statusBar.background` color is set.
